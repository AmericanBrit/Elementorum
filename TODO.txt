TO DO LIST:
 * REPORT: Bug in spell creation. Only creating one spell, never becomes null & doesn't render!
 * Add animations for spells
 * Fix player animations (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/2D-Animation)
 * Fix collision between spells and walls
 * Create collision between walls and obstacles
 * Make game code independent (basically make it so all we have to do to create a new level is insert a new tmx [tilemap] file)
