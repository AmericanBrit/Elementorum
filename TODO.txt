TO DO LIST:
 * Add animations for spells
 * Fix player animations (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/2D-Animation)
 * Fix collision between spells and walls
 * Create collision between walls and obstacles
 * Make game code independent (basically make it so all we have to do to create a new level is insert a new tmx [tilemap] file)
 * Make the code for rock collisions & rendering look neater (make it it's own method)
 * Add collisions between rocks and player, rock and spells, etc.
